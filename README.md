# Flex and Bison college work

This repository contains college problems, examples and homeworks from Compilers class.

We were taught compiler design following `Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition)` book, which I highly recommend.

Practial part was implementing compiler using Flex and Bison to create scanner and parser.
